        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>We are TheDabCorner&trade; LLC. ("Company," "we," "us," "our"), a company registered in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. We operate the website <a href="https://www.thedabcorner.site/">www.thedabcorner.site</a> (the "Site"), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the "Services").</p>
        <p>You can contact us by phone at (314)-325-1750, or by email at <a href="mailto:thedabcorner@outlook.com">thedabcorner@outlook.com</a>.</p>
        <p>These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and TheDabCorner&trade; LLC., concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing and or purchasing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms.</p>
        <h3><strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</strong></h3>
        <p>Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms at any time and for any reason.</p>
        <p>The Services are intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Services. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Legal Terms prior to you using the Services.</p>

        <h2>1. Our Services</h2>
        <p>TheDabCorner&trade; LLC is an elite luxury graphic design firm specializing in the creation of custom packaging, logo design, and comprehensive branding services. Our bespoke designs are delivered as unique digital files (.PDF, .SVG, .AI, .EPS), categorized under custom software. This distinction is due to our method of providing designs as exclusive, one-of-a-kind Scalable Vector Graphic XML formatted source code. This source code can be further interpreted by other software to display our meticulously crafted visual artwork.</p>
        <p>Our offerings are crafted to be used globally, yet they must not be utilized in any jurisdiction or country where such usage would contravene local laws or regulations, or where such usage would necessitate any registration within that jurisdiction. It is the responsibility of our clients to ensure that their use of our services adheres to applicable local laws and regulations. Moreover, our services do not conform to industry-specific regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). Thus, should your engagement require adherence to such regulations, our services may not be suitable for your needs.</p>
        <p>Our services are only intended for use by individuals and businesses capable of forming legally binding contracts. Minors under the age of 18 may only utilize our services under the supervision of a parent or guardian. Businesses utilizing our services must represent that they possess the authority to bind the business to these Legal Terms.</p>
